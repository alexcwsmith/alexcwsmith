### Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹

I am a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai in New York City. My research uses a broad array of behavioral, cellular, and molecular techniques to study synaptic plasticity that results from chronic drug exposure, and how this maladaptive plasticity contributes to heightened vulnerability to relapse during periods of attempted abstinence.

I have been coding in Python since April of 2018. I began on this journey when I became very interested in <b>computational techniques for analyzing large data
 sets, primarily high-volume imaging results from tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy</b>. I use the iDISCO+ tissue clearing method to examine 
 neuroadaptations that occur in rodent models of drug addiction, and Python to automatically detect and count cells, and to segment cell counts into regions by 
 aligning brains to the Allen Brain Atlas. In addition to image processing, I am also interested in applying deep learning to analyze data in novel ways. I have 
 generated a <a href='https://github.com/alexcwsmith/scNLP/>convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for Natural Language Processing</a> via SpaCy, and 
  found that running NLP on large bodies of texts acquired via web searches for genes and neuropsychiatric terms can accurately extract information about 
  contributions of genes to neuropsychiatric disorders.

I conduct high-throughput mapping of immediate early gene expression following exposure to drugs of abuse, and/or following cue-induced drug seeking. This type of 
  mapping allows unbiased discovery of novel regions that are affected by drugs of abuse. I then use iDISCO to map inputs/outputs from these regions, and 
  optogenetic and chemogenetic interrogation of the neurocircuitry of addiction. My repository <a href="http://www.github.com/alexcwsmith/imageProcessing" 
  style="display: inline">imageProcessing</a> contains code for analyzing both c-Fos expression as well as axons segemented by <a href="ilastik.org" 
  style="display: inline">Ilastik</a> or <a href="https://github.com/AlbertPun/TRAILMAP" style="display: inline">TrailMap</a>.
<br>
<br>
The overarching mission for my research career is to use this approach to identify novel circuitry that contributes to substance use disorders (SUDs). The vast 
  majority of research on the neurobiology of addiction for the past three decades has focused on a small number of brain structures, most notably the 
  mesocorticolimbic circuitry and the extended amygdala. Thus, I hypothesize that using unbiased, high-throughput techniques to detect drug-induced maladaptive 
  neuroadaptations throughout the entire brain will be key to development of efficacious pharmacotherapeutics to treat SUDs.

I am currently funded by a K99 from NIDA to identify novel circuitry activated by cue-induced reinstatement of oxycodone seeking (CROS). Following identification novel structures that are necessary for reinstatement, I will use single-cell sequencing to identify genes that are regulated by CROS. In the R00 phase of this project, I will prioritize differentially expressed genes, and identify novel pharmacotherapeutic targets for prevention of relapse.

I have also developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for image enhancment which can be <a href="https://github.com/alexcwsmith/GANfocal/">found here.</a>
