### Hi there, I'm Alex ðŸ‘‹
 
I am a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai in New York City. My training has made me proficient in a broad array of behavioral, cellular, and molecular techniques for studying synaptic plasticity that results from chronic drug exposure, and how this maladaptive plasticity contributes to heightened vulnerability to relapse during periods of attempted abstinence.
<section>
Most recently, I have become very interested in <b>computational techniques for analyzing large data sets, primarily high-volume imaging results from tissue clearing and light-sheet microscopy</b>,

I conduct high-throughput mapping of immediate early gene expression following exposure to drugs of abuse. This type of mapping allows unbiased discovery of novel regions that are activated by these drugs. I then use iDISCO to map inputs/outputs from these regions, and optogenetic and chemogenetic interrogation of the neurocircuitry of addiction. My repository <a href="http://www.github.com/alexcwsmith/imageProcessing" style="display: inline">imageProcessing</a> contains code for analyzing both c-Fos expression as well as axons segemented by <a href="ilastik.org" style="display: inline">Ilastik</a> or <a href="https://github.com/AlbertPun/TRAILMAP" style="display: inline">TrailMap</a>.

I am currently funded by a K99 from NIDA to identify novel circuitry activated by cue-induced reinstatement of oxycodone seeking (CROS). Following identification novel structures that are necessary for reinstatement, I will use single-cell sequencing to identify genes that are regulated by CROS. In the R00 phase of this project, I will prioritize differentially expressed genes, and identify novel pharmacotherapeutic targets for prevention of relapse.
